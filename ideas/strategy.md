# Strategy

Having a next button that gives an exercise to the student.

Strategy = F* + S + T*
F = exercises
S = user's stats
T = tags

To use stats about students, the teacher needs to be able to customize what he wants to collect. For example he would like to track warnings count when a student compiles C programs.
