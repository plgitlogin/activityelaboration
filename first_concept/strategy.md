# Strategies

A strategy manages the dynamic and the interaction of a student with a PLTP.

For example:

- Study mode: Select exercises that the student failed to propose adapted exercises
- Learning mode: Select base exercises
- Fun mode: Allows to challenge other students to complete a maximum of exercises successfully in an allotted time.

The strategy can be created by a teacher. He can define a strategy by giving it a name and a PLTP. The objective is to create strategies that adapt to students data and that gives adapted exercises to each student.
