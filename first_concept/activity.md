# Activities

An activity is the link between PL and the Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle.

The LMS defines an id for the activity that can be used with the name of the LMS to identify the activity in PL.

An activity can be used in multiple courses but there is a distinct instance of the activity per course.

An activity has at least a standard strategy and a PLTP file.

Activité= S + F* + (sd* td* I N B)
I  = Introduction + Documentation
S  = Strategie
F  = pltp + (decorators)
sd = student dashboard
td = teacher dashboard
N  = navigation
B  = Barem (comment est calculé la nte qui remonte à moodle)
